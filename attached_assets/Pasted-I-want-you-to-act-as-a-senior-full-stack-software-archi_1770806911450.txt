I want you to act as a senior full-stack software architect and engineer.

Build a complete production-ready Online Examination System with the following requirements:

=========================
TECH STACK
=========================
Frontend:
- React (with Vite or Next.js)
- React Router
- Axios
- Context API or Redux Toolkit
- TailwindCSS (for styling)
- Dark/Light mode toggle with persistent theme

Backend:
- Java Spring Boot
- RESTful API
- JWT Authentication
- Role-based Authorization
- WebSocket support (for real-time exam timer and submission)

Database:
- PostgreSQL

DevOps:
- Docker (Dockerfiles for frontend, backend, database)
- Docker Compose for orchestration
- Ansible playbook for deployment automation

=========================
CORE FEATURES
=========================

1. Authentication System
- Login and Signup pages
- Store users in PostgreSQL
- Passwords must be hashed using BCrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Role field in User entity: ADMIN or STUDENT
- After login:
    - ADMIN → Redirect to Admin Dashboard
    - STUDENT → Redirect to Student Dashboard
- Protect routes based on role

2. User Entity (Database)
Fields:
- id (UUID)
- fullName
- email (unique)
- password (hashed)
- role (ADMIN or STUDENT)
- createdAt

3. Admin Dashboard
Admin can:
- Create exams
- Add questions (MCQ and short answer)
- Set exam duration
- Assign exams to students
- View all students
- View results
- Delete or edit exams
- Monitor active exam sessions (real-time)
- View analytics (average score, pass rate)

4. Student Dashboard
Students can:
- View assigned exams
- Start exam (real-time countdown)
- Submit answers
- View results after grading
- Search for past results
- See score breakdown

5. Exam System
Entities:
- Exam
- Question
- Option (for MCQ)
- Submission
- Answer

Features:
- Timed exams
- Auto-submit when timer ends
- Real-time countdown using WebSockets
- MCQ auto-grading
- Short answers manually graded by Admin
- Store submission history
- Prevent multiple attempts (unless configured)

6. Real-Time Features
- Use WebSockets (Spring Boot + STOMP)
- Live countdown timer
- Immediate submission status update
- Prevent cheating via timer sync

7. Dark and Light Mode
- Toggle button in navbar
- Persist selection in localStorage
- Tailwind dark mode configuration
- Apply theme globally

8. API Design
Follow REST best practices:
- /api/auth/register
- /api/auth/login
- /api/admin/exams
- /api/student/exams
- /api/submissions
- etc.

Return proper HTTP status codes.

9. Security
- JWT authentication filter
- Role-based method security
- CORS configuration
- Input validation
- Exception handling middleware

10. Docker Setup
Create:
- Dockerfile for frontend
- Dockerfile for backend
- docker-compose.yml including:
    - frontend
    - backend
    - postgres

Ensure services communicate correctly.

11. Ansible
Create:
- Inventory file
- Playbook that:
    - Installs Docker
    - Pulls project
    - Runs docker-compose
    - Sets environment variables

=========================
PROJECT STRUCTURE
=========================

Provide full folder structure for:
- frontend
- backend
- database
- docker
- ansible

=========================
WHAT I EXPECT FROM YOU
=========================

1. Step-by-step implementation
2. Backend first (entities, repositories, services, controllers)
3. Then frontend (pages, routing, dashboards)
4. API integration
5. WebSocket implementation
6. Docker configuration
7. Ansible configuration
8. Environment variables configuration
9. Instructions to run locally
10. Instructions to deploy

Make sure:
- Everything connects properly
- All API calls match frontend usage
- Authentication works correctly
- Role-based redirection works
- Real-time exam submission works
- Code is clean and production-ready
- Use best practices

Generate the complete working system.
